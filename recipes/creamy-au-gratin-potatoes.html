  <p style="font-size: 18px;">These au gratin potatoes are my favorite! The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in this classic French dish combine to make a deliciously addictive experience.</p> 
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">Serve potatoes au gratin with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin, alongside a green salad and some French bread. Experiment with different cheeses for variety.</p>
